# Design-of-a-detailed-electrical-services-of-a-two-storied-building
This project contains a complete, practical design of the electrical services for a two-storey residential/commercial building. It covers load assessment, distribution design, protection, earthing, lighting & small power layout, and documentation needed for construction and handover.

Objectives

Provide safe, code-compliant electrical design for a two-storey building.

Produce clear drawings, calculations, and schedules for installation and testing.

Deliver documentation suitable for contractors, reviewers, and as a GitHub reference.

Scope

Load estimation and demand/load schedules (lighting, receptacles, HVAC, water heating, small motors).

Main distribution: single-line diagram, incoming service, meter locations, main switchgear.

Subdistribution: floor panels, final circuits, cable sizing, conduits, trunking.

Protective devices: MCCB/MCB selection, coordination, earth leakage protection (RCD/ELCB) where required.

Earthing & bonding: earth electrode system, equipotential bonding, lightning protection considerations.

Lighting design: luminaires selection, emergency/exit lighting, lighting control (switching, dimming zones).

Fire alarm, smoke detection and basic low-voltage systems provision (optional: data/telephone/CCTV).

Schedules: panel schedule, circuit schedule, cable schedule, bill of materials.

Key Design Steps

Survey and define building loads and usage per room/area.

Create load schedule and apply diversity factors to determine demand load.

Select service size and incoming conductors; prepare single-line diagram.

Size feeders, final circuits and protective devices (current carrying capacity, voltage drop, short-circuit & selective coordination).

Design earthing and select earth electrodes; size protective bonding conductors.

Produce layout drawings (plan views + riser) showing lighting, sockets, DBs, and equipment.

Prepare installation notes, testing & commissioning plan, and safety precautions.

Standards & Tools (examples)

Applicable standards: local electrical code / NEC / IEC / BS standards (choose per jurisdiction).

Tools: Microsoft Visio (drawings), spreadsheet (load & cable calculations).

Deliverables

Single-line diagram, floor electrical plans, riser diagrams.

Load calculations, cable & protection schedules, BOQ.

Installation notes, testing & commissioning checklist, O&M recommendations.
